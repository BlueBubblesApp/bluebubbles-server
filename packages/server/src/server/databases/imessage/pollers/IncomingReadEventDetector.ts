 * a snapshot: a chat read last week and unread today still matches. Using it to

 * the unread tally is what decides, not the presence of a read timestamp.
 *
 * Only real messages count toward that tally. `item_type != 0` rows are system
 * events (group renames, participants added or removed) and rows with an
 * `associated_message_type` are tapbacks and edits. Apple badges none of them,
 * yet they carry `is_read = 0` forever, so counting them reports chats as unread
 * that the phone shows as read -- 170 chats here versus the true 2.
